# Application stack

## Architecture

Internote is designed as a fully serverless application. This means that both the front-end and the back-end services are stateless, with persistence handled by external file storage and database storage.

Internote's front-end and back-end services are written in Typescript and the project is structured as a mono-repository to make use of efficient code-sharing where useful. For example, API DTOs are written in Typescript and are shared across the front-end and the back-end.

## Local development

Since Internote runs on a serverless stack, it isn't possible (without significant set-up) to run the whole stack locally. Instead, it is advised to rely on unit / integration testing to develop individual services (mocking out any dependent services where necessary). Alternatively, the `dev` stage can be deployed to during development, providing that the risk of data corruption is kept to a minimum.

The front-end application can be run locally and is set up to run against the `dev` stage back-end services. Bear in mind that running locally is not the same as a built version of the front-end so it's advised to deploy and test against the `dev` stage before promoting the build to production.

## Front-end stack

- TypeScript
- React
- Next.js
- Twine
- Styled Components
- Storybook
- Slate
- AWS API Gateway
- AWS Lambda
- AWS S3
- AWS CloudWatch
- AWS CloudFront
- AWS Route53

## Back-end stack

- Middy
- DynamoDB
- Type Dynamo
- AWS Lambda
- AWS S3
- AWS Cognito User Pools
- AWS Cognito Federated Identities
- API Gateway
- AWS CloudWatch
- AWS CloudFront
- AWS Polly
- Oxford Dictionary API

## Back-end services

There are several independent micro-services, each responsible for a portion of the overall back-end. Each service is deployed using the Serverless framework and there's a shared library of utilities that are used in multiple services.

The Internote services are organised using a yarn workspaces mono-repository, though maintain autonomy and isolation from one another in terms of deployment and resources.

**Auth**

Authentication in Internote is powered by AWS Cognito and follows a password-less experience whereby the user does not set their own password, but instead, receives a one-time pass-code for signing up or signing in via email (SES is used for e-mail sending).

The authentication credentials are used to sign requests to other services using AWS Signing Key Signatures. These include requests to API Gateway or S3 for example using a Cognito Federated Identity. Other services are authorized using API Gateway's IAM authorization (this means that authorization is handled prior to lambdas that require authorization being invoked).

The auth service sets up a Cognito User Pool, Cognito Identity Pool, Cognito User Pool Client and the associated IAM roles and permissions to link them together.

**Health**

The health service is the "master" service which means it sets up the API Gateway (and exposes it) to the other services.

The health services also exposes two endpoints. One that does not require authentication and one that does for the purpose of testing the Serverless set up.

**Attachments**

The attachments service is responsible for facilitating client uploads to an S3 bucket for storing inside notes. For example, images and videos.

It is important that the client uploads these attachments directly to the S3 bucket, since it's discouraged to supply an endpoint to facilitate the same.

**Notes**

The notes service is responsible for the creation, deletion, listing and management of notes in the Internote app.

**Preferences**

The preferences service is responsible for the creation, management and retrieval of user settings such as colour scheme, focus mode etc.

**APIs, DTOs and validation**

Each Internote service defines it's own types for request and response DTOs. These types are consumed by client applications to construct strongly-typed SDKs on top of the services.

Each Internote service defines request body validation using API Gateway Request Body Validations using the Serverless framework as per this guide.

**Database**

The Internote services use DynamoDB for data persistence. Each service is responsible for defining it's own DynamoDB schema and management.

The Internote services uses Type Dynamo as an ORM on top of DynamoDB. Since DynamoDB is schemaless, attributes that are added to a model after initial set up and deployment are defined as optional attributes and are enforced as such using strict TypeScript compiler options.

**Domains**

There are two domains available for Internote services:

- https://dev-services.internote.app
- https://services.internote.app

Each service is responsible for defining it's routing via it's serverless.yml definition. Deployment of the API gateway and domain name is done in the services/health/serverless.yml[/services/health/serverless.yml] service via serverless-domain-manager.

**API Gateway**

An API Gateway is created by the Serverless framework to route traffic from the internet through to the lambdas that power the Internote services. Each service references this API Gateway in it's Serverless set up as to use the same API Gateway.

Since the Internote services are designed to be called by a 3rd party client application (such as the front-end that powers the Internote editor), CORS is enabled for every lambda that the front-end hits directly.

**SSL**

SSL certificates are managed by AWS Certificate Manager where a sub-domain wildcard SSL certificate is linked with the API gateway that powers Internote services.

**Set up**

Since Route53 is not covered by the Serverless framework, the domain and SSL set up is managed manually through Route53 and AWS Certificate Manager using the AWS console.

**Email**

The Internote services send emails to users. Amazon SES is set up and configured for this purpose and is set up loosely according to these guidelines.

Note that SES is set up manually outside of the Serverless framework using the AWS console.

The Internote service's lambdas are set up to send from "no-reply@internote.app"

**Receiving email**

Although Internote does not support replies on emails sent to users, an S3 bucket is set up to receive e-mails.

# Deployment

## Set up

Deployment is managed by the Serverless Framework deploying to AWS. To set up Serverless, follow the official documentation ensuring that Serverless is set up with the correct AWS credentials.

## Domains & SSL certificates

The domain names for deployment are managed manually through a combination of Route53, CloudFront and AWS Certificate Manager. To set the domain names up, head to the AWS console and do the following:

- Create a custom domain name in Route53
- Create a SSL certificate in AWS Certificate Manager. The certificate has to be in the `us-east-1` AWS region for it to work with CloudFront.
- Link up the SSL certificate with the domain name in API Gateway
- Grab the SSL certificate ARN from AWS Certificate Manager and enter it in to the cloudFront configuration in ui/serverless.yml
- Once deployed, link up the CloudFront distribution with the custom domain name in Route53 by ensuring there's an A record who's "Alias Target" points to the CloudFront "Domain Name"

## Stages

There are two stages set up for Internote (both front-end and back-end). The first is the `dev` stage that can be broken (if needed). The second is production that should be as stable as possible.

## Regions

By default, all AWS services are created in the `eu-west-1` (Ireland) region.

Some AWS services global are not tied to regions, such as AWS S3, AWS CloudFront, AWS Route53 etc.

There is a special mention for the front-end Next.js SSR Lambdas, which are deployed as Lambda@Edge functions. These are deployed in the `us-east-1` region for [reasons specified here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-requirements-limits.html). See the `ui/serverless.yml` for more information.

# Environment variables

There are multiple ways that environment variables are handled in Internote.

## Non sensitive variables

Non-sensitive environment variables such as the "stage" (production or development), the AWS region etc are stored as environment variables in the Serverless framework configuration files in the codebase. These are committed to source control.

## Sensitive variables

Sensitive variables (such as private API keys) are stored in AWS Parameter Store and are referenced inside the Serverless framework configuration files in the codebase. These variables are not committed to source control.

**Important: **Since the Serverless framework does not have SSM permissions by default they need to be added to the Serverless user in IAM. See below for more info.

In general, secrets stored in SSM are prefixed with the "stage". For example `/internote/dev/OXFORD_API_ID` / `/internote/prod/OXFORD_API_ID`. These are then referenced in the relevant `serverless.yml` files using string substitution on the stage of the deployment.

## Front-end environment variables

Since Serverless components has not figured out a good way to deal with secret environment variables properly (with respect to KMS), the [`aws-env`](https://github.com/Droplr/aws-env) executable is used to generate a `.env` file in the root of the `ui` project from AWS SSM variables. Serverless components then picks up the keys in the `.env` file and loads them in to the app. The `.env` file is in `.gitignore`.

## Variable explanations

- **`OXFORD_API_ID`**: The Oxford Dictionary application ID used for looking up words. Can be in the Oxford Dictionary admin panel here
- **`OXFORD_API_KEY`**: The Oxford Dictionary application key used for looking up words. Can be in the Oxford Dictionary admin panel here
- **`COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID`**: The Cognito user pool ID for authentication. Can be found in the Cognito user pool settings here.
- **`COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID`**: The Cognito user pool client ID for authentication. Can be found in the Cognito user pool settings here (head to App client settings and look for "id").
- **`SERVICES_HOST`**: The domain name that the back-end services are deployed under. Can be found in the "domains" section here
- **`SERVICES_REGION`**: The AWS region that the back-end services are deployed in. This is eu-west-1.
- **`COGNITO_IDENTITY_POOL_ID`**: The Cognito identity pool ID for authentication. Can be found in the Cognito identity pool settings here.
- **`ATTACHMENTS_BUCKET_NAME`**: The name of the bucket where note attachments reside. Can be found here.
- **`SPEECH_BUCKET_NAME`**: The name of the bucket where generated speech files reside. Can be found here.

## Next.js environment variables set-up

In terms of Next.js, the environment variables are substituted at build-time using Next.js's `env` config option.

When running `yarn dev` locally, the environment variables are loaded using `aws-env` (you will have to `chmod +x aws-env` once it has installed).

When building in serverless, the environment variables are loaded using serverless SSM variables.

# CI / CD

Continuous integration & delivery is managed by seed.run and is set up to automatically deploy the application upon pushes to master.

## Automatic deployment

Since the application is running on seed.run's free tier, it's important to keep commits to master to a minimum in order to not run out of deployment minutes. For this reason, it's advised to open branches and pull requests, so that only merges are deployed.

## Seed.run IAM

There is a CloudFormation stack set up to manage iAM roles etc that seed.run needs, which was set up by seed.run when the project was set up. However, since Internote uses font-awesome, the npm token needs to be added as an environment variable to seed.run. Please see `seed.yml` and the official documentation for more info.

# Logs

## Serverless

Serverless dashboard is available: https://dashboard.serverless.com.

In order to set it up, run `serverless` in your terminal and run through the registration / login process and redeploy the services. After this, they will automatically appear in the serverless dashboard.

## CloudWatch

Logging is available in CloudWatch inside the AWS console.

## Dashbird

Logging and metrics are also available in Dashbird.

There is a CloudFormation stack set up to manage iAM roles etc that Dashbird needs. These were provisioned by Dashbird when the project was set up.

The serverless policy needs the following additional permissions to deploy the app:

- "s3:PutBucketAcl"
- "acm:ListCertificates"
- "apigateway:GET"
- "apigateway:DELETE"
- "apigateway:POST"
